Configuration of the PDFjam utilities involves specifying the location of
pdflatex, the location of temporary files, specification of default page size,
etc.  This is done in a block of lines near the top of the pdfjam script;
settings made there are over-ridden by any that are found at a site-wide
configuration file (at /etc/pdfjam.conf, /usr/share/etc/pdfjam.conf,
/usr/local/share/pdfjam.conf, or /usr/local/etc/pdfjam.conf), which in turn are
over-ridden by any that are found in a user-defaults file at ~/.pdfjam.conf\&.
